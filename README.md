#Informational Site

##Purpose
The purpose of this project is to set up basic routes using ExpressJS for a basic website. It does not do anything complex. Here we just handle route visits across the different links on the navigational header.

##How to run
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository and then run `npm install`. This will install the required dependencies
to run this project.
3. Finally, run `npm start` to start the server. Any changes you make to any files will reload
the server thanks to Nodemon. No need to restart the server once you make any modifications to it.
