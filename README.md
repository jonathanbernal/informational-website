# Informational Site

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to set up basic routes using ExpressJS for a basic website. It does not do anything complex. Here we just handle route visits across the different links on the navigational header.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository and then run `npm install`. This will install the required dependencies
to run this project.
3. Finally, run `npm start` to start the server. Any changes you make to any files will reload
